We hit the big list destinations: Cadillac Mountain, Jordan’s Pond House, the Park Loop Road but we leave knowing there are so many other destinations within the park that we missed.  We barely scratched the surface, but that’s okay because it has inspired us to return.  The Rangers and staff were very friendly and accommodating, the park does a good job regarding social distancing, the bathrooms were clean and if you plan to travel to Cadillac Mountain or Sand Beach, Make sure you pre-register online prior to arrival through the end of October.  They do this to control the crowds and you will not be able to get to the Summit or to Sand Beach without a printed registration.  Go to their website, register and print, the cost is 1.00.  We saw a lot of visitors turned away without the registration.\\nThis was an amazing experience and I hope I get the opportunity to return!',\n",
