# Portfolio Projects
This repository contains a variety of my data science portfolio projects covering different topics.

Note: Because some data files are too large, they might not be committed. Please refer to the project descriptions below on the data sources.

- ### [Regression Analysis and Web App - Used Car Prices Prediction](https://github.com/tonyychen/Projects/tree/master/Portfolio%20Projects/Regression%20Analysis%20and%20Web%20App%20-%20Used%20Car%20Prices%20Prediction)

	**Highlights of this project**:
	- Data pre-processing and text manipulations
	- RandomForestRegressor and methods on regression performance evaluation/improvements
	- Building a web app that accepts user input to make predictions

	The following description is from Kaggle:
    	
	**Context**
	
	Craigslist is the world's largest collection of used vehicles for sale, yet it's very difficult to collect all of them in the same place. I built a scraper for a school project and expanded upon it later to create this dataset which includes every used vehicle entry within the United States on Craigslist.
	
	**Content**
	This data is scraped every few months, it contains most all relevant information that Craigslist provides on car sales including columns like price, condition, manufacturer, latitude/longitude, and 18 other categories. For ML projects, consider feature engineering on location columns such as long/lat. For previous listings, check older versions of the dataset.
