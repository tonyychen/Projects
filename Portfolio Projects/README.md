# Portfolio Projects
This repository contains a variety of my data science portfolio projects covering different topics.

Note: Because some data files are too large, they might not be committed. Please refer to the project descriptions below on the data sources.

**Github sometimes has issues with rendering Jupyter Notebooks, please use https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and paste the github link to view the notebooks if Github fails. Thanks.**

- ### [Image Classification using CNN](https://github.com/tonyychen/Projects/blob/master/Portfolio%20Projects/CNN%20Classification.ipynb)

	**Highlights of this project**:
	- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Tensorflow
	- Image Augmentation to prevent overfitting
	- Transfer Learning from Inception V3
	- Classification with Sparse Categorical Cross-entropy Loss

	**Citation:**
	This notebook was directly run as a notebook on Kaggle, it is using Intel Image Classification Dataset as well as built on existing model on Inception V3

	**The following descriptions are from Kaggle:**
	
	**Context**
	
	This is image data of Natural Scenes around the world.
	
	**Content**
	
	This Data contains around 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories. The Train, Test and Prediction data is separated in each zip files. There are around 14k images in Train, 3k in Test and 7k in Prediction.This data was initially published on https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com by Intel to host a Image classification Challenge.

- ### [Regression Analysis and Web App - Used Car Prices Prediction](https://github.com/tonyychen/Projects/tree/master/Portfolio%20Projects/Regression%20Analysis%20and%20Web%20App%20-%20Used%20Car%20Prices%20Prediction)

	**Highlights of this project**:
	- Data pre-processing and text manipulations
	- RandomForestRegressor and methods on regression performance evaluation/improvements
	- Building a web app that accepts user input to make predictions
	
    
	**Citation:**
	This dataset is from Kaggle - Used Cars Dataset
	
	URL: https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data
	
	**The following descriptions are from Kaggle:**
    	
	**Context**
	
	Craigslist is the world's largest collection of used vehicles for sale, yet it's very difficult to collect all of them in the same place. I built a scraper for a school project and expanded upon it later to create this dataset which includes every used vehicle entry within the United States on Craigslist.
	
	**Content**
	
	This data is scraped every few months, it contains most all relevant information that Craigslist provides on car sales including columns like price, condition, manufacturer, latitude/longitude, and 18 other categories. For ML projects, consider feature engineering on location columns such as long/lat. For previous listings, check older versions of the dataset.
