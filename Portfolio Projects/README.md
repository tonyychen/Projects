2. **Regression Analysis and Web App - Used Car Prices Prediction**

	**Highlights of this project**:
	* Data pre-processing and text manipulations
	* RandomForestRegressor and methods on regression performance evaluation/improvements
	* Building a web app that accepts user input to make predictions
    
    *Note that due to the hosting size constraint, the web app was not deployed to a specific server and server dependencies are not reflected in the project requirements. I would continue to work to resolve this issue. Meanwhile, the project files (including data files) can be accessed at:

    This dataset is from Kaggle - Used Cars Dataset

    URL: https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data

    The following description is from Kaggle:

    **Context**

    Craigslist is the world's largest collection of used vehicles for sale, yet it's very difficult to collect all of them in the same place. I built a scraper for a school project and expanded upon it later to create this dataset which includes every used vehicle entry within the United States on Craigslist.

    **Content**

    This data is scraped every few months, it contains most all relevant information that Craigslist provides on car sales including columns like price, condition, manufacturer, latitude/longitude, and 18 other categories. For ML projects, consider feature engineering on location columns such as long/lat. For previous listings, check older versions of the dataset.
